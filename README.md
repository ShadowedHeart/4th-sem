1.Implemeted the api waiting time fallback mechanism animation like progress spinner from mui.
2.To optimize the application i used lazy loading hooks for better performance.
3.I used the typewriter-effect library for the effect in my home page.
4.I got problem fecthing api which contained array of object, later I reolved by making the initial useState value []     instead of null, since previously we were using stringyfy for sending the data.
5. Implemented the stickman running animation, whenever we hover over the icon it will run like now we are going for that application network.
6. Created a sample Portfolio using canva and can be downloaded on the system.
