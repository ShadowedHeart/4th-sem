Project Overview<br/>

1.Implemeted the api waiting time fallback mechanism animation like progress spinner from mui.<br/>
2.To optimize the application i used lazy loading hooks for better performance.<br/>
3.I used the typewriter-effect library for the effect in my home page.<br/>
4.I got problem fecthing api which contained array of object, later I reolved by making the initial <br/>useState value [] instead of null, since previously we were using stringyfy for sending the data. 
5. Implemented the stickman running animation, whenever we hover over the icon it will run like now <br/>we are going for that application network. 
6. Created a sample Portfolio using canva and can be downloaded on the system.<br/>
