<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<br/>

1. Implemeted the api waiting time fallback mechanism animation like progress spinner from mui.<br/>
2. To optimize the application i used lazy loading hooks for better performance.<br/>
3. I used the typewriter-effect library for the effect in my home page.<br/>
4. I got problem fecthing api which contained array of object, later I reolved by making the initial useState value [] instead of null, since previously we were using stringyfy for 
 sending the data.<br>
5. Implemented the stickman running animation, whenever we hover over the icon it will run like now we are going for that application network.<br> 
6. Created a sample Portfolio using canva and can be downloaded on the system.<br/>
